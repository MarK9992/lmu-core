# LMU Eclipse Plugin

`lmu-eclipse-plugin` is a retro-engineering class group work at [Polytech Nice-Sophia][1].

The goal is to create an ecplise plugin allowing to use [`lmu`][2] inside the eclipse IDE so a programmer could use it to generate class diagrams for Java projects. This repository contains the re-engineered LMU core, see [here][4]. The eclipse plugin part is contained in [this repository][5].

## LMU

`lmu` is a class diagram generation tool for Java code written by [Luc Hogie][3].

More information can be found [here][2].

## LMU Core

`lmu` was re-engineered in order to extract its core logic and to improve the code's quality. The details of this re-engineering work in this [report][6] (french).
